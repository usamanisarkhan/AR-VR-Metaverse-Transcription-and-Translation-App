# AR/VR Metaverse Transcription & Translation App

An AI-powered transcription and translation system designed for Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) platforms.  
This app enables real-time, low-latency speech-to-text and translation conversion, improving accessibility, productivity, and collaboration in immersive environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time speech-to-text transcription from video/audio input  
- Translation of transcribed text into different languages (if implemented)  
- Designed for AR/VR use-cases where latency and clarity matter  
- Easy to test locally with sample video inputs

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+  
- Required Python packages (listed below)  
- Working microphone / video sample for testing (if needed)  

---

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/usamanisarkhan/AR-VR-Metaverse-Transcription-and-Translation-App.git
    cd AR-VR-Metaverse-Transcription-and-Translation-App
    ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS / Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main script with a sample video:

    ```bash
    python SpeechToTextVideo.py --input input_video.mp4
    ```

---

## 📊 Usage Examples

- Transcribing speech from a video file:  
  ```bash
  python SpeechToTextVideo.py --input path/to/video.mp4
Translating the output (if translation feature is supported):

bash
Copy code
python SpeechToTextVideo.py --input path/to/video.mp4 --translate to_language_code
✨ Improvements & Roadmap
Add support for live streaming audio from AR/VR devices

Improve translation accuracy & support more languages

Integrate with AR/VR frameworks (Unity, Unreal Engine, WebXR, etc.)

Build a UI (in-VR overlay) to display transcriptions in immersive environments

Optimize for performance & latency

🔍 Dependencies
Make sure these are installed (your requirements.txt might include):

speechrecognition or similar speech-to-text library

moviepy or opencv for video processing

Language translation library (e.g. googletrans or similar)

Any other required fonts/assets
